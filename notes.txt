1. utils.py
Purpose:
Small helper tools used across the project.
Currently it only has one function — ensure_datetime_index().
What it does:
Cleans and organizes time columns (like “created_utc”) by:
Converting them into proper date/time objects (so pandas understands them).
Dropping invalid ones.
Sorting chronologically.
Making that column the DataFrame index.
Why it matters:
All your other files depend on having properly formatted timestamps.




📈 2. data/price.py
Purpose:
Gets historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
What it does:
Uses the yfinance library to download prices for a given ticker (like “TSLA”).
Cleans the columns (makes lowercase names).
Calculates daily returns (how much the stock moved each day).
Returns only what you need: adj close and ret (return).
Why it matters:
This is your “ground truth” — the real stock market data you’ll compare sentiment against.

RETURNS A CLEANED DATAFRAME OF DAILY RETURNS FOR A CERTAIN TICKER. 
THIS WILL BE USED TO COMPARE THE SENTIMENT DATA AGAINST




💬 3. data/altdata.py
Purpose:
Loads your “alternative data” — in this case, Reddit or Twitter posts.
What it does:
Reads the CSV file you made (reddit_tesla.csv).
Checks that it has the right columns (created_utc and text).
Uses ensure_datetime_index() to turn timestamps into real datetimes.
Makes sure the text column is clean (no missing values).
Why it matters:
This gives you a clean table of posts ready for sentiment scoring.

READS THE REDDIT POSTS CSV FILE AND RETURNS A CLEANED DATAFRAME OF POSTS READY 
TO BE ANALYSED BY SENTIMENT.PY 




❤️ 4. features/sentiment.py
Purpose:
Analyzes the mood (sentiment) of each post using VADER.
What it does:
score_text() → gives each post a score between -1 (negative) and +1 (positive).
daily_sentiment() → groups posts by day, then calculates:
mean sentiment (average daily mood)
median sentiment
n_posts (number of posts that day)
Why it matters:
This converts messy human language into numeric features that can be tested against stock prices.

ANALYSES THE SENTIMENT OF EACH POST IN THE DATAFRAME AND ASSIGNS IT A SCORE FROM 1 (+VE) TO -1 (-VE)
CONVERTS THE LANGUAGE INTO A NUMERICAL SCORE TO BE COMPARED AGAINST STOCK STATISTICS (DAILY RETURN ETC.)




⚙️ 5. backtest/strategy.py
Purpose:
Simulates a simple trading strategy based on the sentiment signal.
What it does:
Converts daily sentiment into positions:
+1 → buy, -1 → short, 0 → stay out.
Shifts returns by one day (so you only act on yesterday’s data — no cheating).
Applies trading costs (a few basis points per trade).
Calculates the running total of profit/loss over time (equity curve).
Why it matters:
This tests whether sentiment data gives a trading edge — i.e., if “buy when people are happy” beats random chance.

SIMPLE TRADING STRATEGY TO LONG OR SHORT POSITIONS BASED ON THE SENTIMENT SCORE 
USES BASIS POINTS TO ACCOUNT FOR REAL LIFE SLIPPAGE AND EXTERNAL FEES 
TESTS IF THE SENTIMENT DATA HELPS WITH TRADING 


📊 6. evaluation/metrics.py
Purpose:
Calculates key performance statistics for your strategy.
What it does:
Sharpe ratio: how much return you get per unit of risk.
Max drawdown: biggest drop from a previous peak (shows worst-case loss).
CAGR: compound annual growth rate (yearly growth if you reinvested profits).
Why it matters:
These metrics let you compare your sentiment strategy to a simple “buy & hold.”
